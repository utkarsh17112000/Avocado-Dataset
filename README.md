# Avocado-Dataset
🟩 Data Analysis Practice with the Avocado Dataset 🥑📈

As part of my ongoing journey in data analytics, I explored the popular Avocado dataset to practice a variety of real-world business insights using Excel, SQL, and data visualization tools.

🔍 This project helped me analyze:

📊 Price trends across regions

🛒 Organic vs. Conventional price comparison

📆 Seasonal sales trends by month and quarter

🌎 Regions with highest volume, revenue, and volatility

💼 Top performing regions by total volume and revenue

📉 Annual price percent change & price elasticity

📦 Correlation between total volume and bags sold

📅 Top sales dates & peak sales months by year

Each analysis focused on uncovering actionable insights like: ✔️ Which regions consistently see higher/lower prices?

 ✔️ How do organic vs conventional avocado prices behave?

 ✔️ What months/quarters are most profitable for avocado sales?

 ✔️ Where does the market show the highest volatility or demand?

📁 This was a great dataset to explore data cleaning, trend analysis, visual storytelling, and business insight extraction.
